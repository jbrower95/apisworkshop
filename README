HACK@BROWN 2016: APIs workshop

	Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to come build awesome things with us.

	We're going to build a Javascript application that combines the Flickr API
	with the Brown API for dining. We're going to show people what's being
	served at the Ratty!

	These tutorials use jQuery, a free / open source Javascript library that makes
	some of what we do easier. As jQuery is written in Javascript, it's totally feasible
	to write these applications without jQuery.
